# ApexGPT

A Formula 1 chat assistant. Ask about drivers, constructors, circuits, seasons, races, crashes, rivalries and championship battles from **1950 to 2025**, and get grounded answers with sources.

ApexGPT uses a hybrid RAG design: statistical questions are answered with SQL over structured F1 data, and narrative questions with vector search over curated F1 articles. It runs entirely on free models and services.

> **Status:** in development (MVP). See [docs/PROGRESS.md](docs/PROGRESS.md).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python, FastAPI |
| Frontend | Next.js (TypeScript, Tailwind) |
| Database | Postgres + pgvector (Neon in production, Docker locally) |
| Embeddings / reranking | fastembed (`bge-small-en-v1.5`, `bge-reranker-base`) |
| LLM | Free tiers via LiteLLM: Groq → Gemini → OpenRouter |
| Data | Jolpica-F1 (structured), Wikipedia (narrative, CC BY-SA) |
| Infra | Docker, Docker Compose, Coolify |

## Repository Layout

```
backend/     FastAPI app (API, retrieval, LLM, tools)
ingestion/   Offline data pipelines (Jolpica, Wikipedia → pgvector)
frontend/    Next.js app
eval/        Golden question set and evaluation runner
docs/        Plans, data strategy and progress tracker
data/        Raw downloads (git-ignored)
```

Directories are added as their features land (see the plan).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Python 3.12+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js 22+
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) (`uv tool install pre-commit`)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RChaubey16/apexgpt.git
cd apexgpt
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in values
pre-commit install
```

Running the whole app with `docker compose up` arrives in Phase 0 (F0.5).

### Database

Local Postgres 18 + pgvector 0.8.1 (matches Neon's default):

```bash
docker compose up -d db                  # bound to 127.0.0.1:5432 only
cd backend && uv run alembic upgrade head
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
uv sync                                  # install dependencies (incl. dev)
uv run uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory --reload   # http://localhost:8000/health, docs at /docs
uv run pytest                            # unit tests (no database needed)

# Integration tests: real DB. They migrate up/down, so never use a DB with real data.
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://apexgpt:change-me@localhost:5432/apexgpt \
  uv run pytest -m integration
```

Health endpoints: `/health` is liveness only and never touches the DB, so the 30s Docker healthcheck doesn't keep Neon awake. `/health/ready` checks the DB and returns 503 if it's unreachable.

Docker image (production target):

```bash
docker build -t apexgpt-backend backend/
docker run -p 8000:8000 apexgpt-backend
```

## Development Workflow

- One feature at a time on a `feature/<name>` branch created from `main`.
- Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `security:`).
- Every feature goes through a PR against `main`, reviewed before merge.
- Lint and tests must pass before a feature is committed.

Details: [docs/MVP-PLAN.md §5](docs/MVP-PLAN.md#5-development-workflow).
